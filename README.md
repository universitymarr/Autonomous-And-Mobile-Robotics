## Notes

> **NOTE:** Notes file are too big for GitHub so they have been uploaded on a shared Google Drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12R4mkcvvb4Q6jiQ_ZBmae_PL0kD0Wia9

> **NOTE:** In Notes, Chapter 12 (`Artificial Potential Fields`) is incomplete, as well as Chapter 13 (`Humanoids`) that is missing.<br>

## Formulary
The document `Useful Facts & Formulary.pdf` serves as a valuable resource for understanding the various **AMR** exercises.<br>
It provides basic information on various topics, including:
- Global/Local mobility
- Constraints
- Kinematic models
- Controllability
- Chained Forms
- Path and Trajectory Planning
- Flat Outputs
- Trajectory Tracking
- Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)

Furthermore, it offers in-depth summaries of the following chapters (_in preparation for the 2nd part of the Midterm_):
- Motion Planning (using also portions of **Notes**)
- Humanoids (basic concepts - written from scratch)

Please note that the argument `Humanoid Robots: Gait generation` has not been addressed (_shouldn't be necessary though_)

Finally, it has a formulary with the needed formulas for the Unicycle & Bicycle.
